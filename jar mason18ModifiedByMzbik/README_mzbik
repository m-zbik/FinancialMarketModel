This is the massage form the original mason. The file was in 
the jar folder. 
****Original massage*****
This directory is where MASON will build the mason.jar file.
Do NOT put other jar files in here, because if you run 'make clean'
on the Makefile, MASON will delete all jar files located here.
If you have libraries on which MASON relies (such as jmf.jar or
itext.jar), place them in your CLASSPATH in an appropriate location,
or (if you use the start scripts in MASON) alternatively in
the mason/ directory directly.
